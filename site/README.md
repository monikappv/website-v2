## Why we're here

Data integration is essential –- but currently painful and confusing. We want to to bring simplicity and gracefulness to the messy world of data.

We want building data pipelines is as easy as playing with LEGO. We want a frictionless data ecosystem built on the unix philosophy where data flows with simplicity and grace across diverse tools and teams, enabled by the specs and patterns we have shared. We want everyone working with data to have access to these core patterns and tools.

We imagine a data ecosystem that is effortless, pure and clear. Where data flows everywhere, effortlessly and easily -- like water.

## What we do

We offer vision, patterns, specifications and tools that bring simplicity & ease to transform the data experience. We help you generate clean data efficiently and reliably gain ongoing insights. We help you standardize, package, validate, share, and publish your data.

## Who we are here for

We are here for the data wranglers and the data geeks. The people who work with data day to day -- and those who design solutions for them. People who have moved beyond the quick hack in a notebook. People looking for the power of the command line but without the bulk and inelegance of big data tooling. They are data engineers and data scientists, researchers and technologists.

## What's different about us?

We work with, add to and enhance your existing tooling (progressive enhancement). We're lightweight and coherent. We have a big vision and small tools. We cover the whole data journey to and from the end user -- our patterns and tools can apply to Excel as well as Hadoop.
